1)Did you check the 0.05 cm signal window is optimal or not. Does the ans change if you change this width of window?
2)Estimate systametics associated to this cut, i.e the way of estimating efficiwncy is somewhat overcalculation because of background cluster.
3)Is the Residual plot associated to 513V(low efficiency) sensor is OK?
