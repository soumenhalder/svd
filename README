After getting output from module again run in kekcc with several cuts and taking one cluster per intercept 
Try to use any git to save the record for this status

dimuon cut(data and mc)
10 strips from end are excluded both intercepts ntuple and cluster ntuple
number of track=2
accolinearity <10 deg
dr<2 dz<4
35<theta<125
0<ecl<0.7GeV for each track


bhabha cut
10 strips from end are excluded both intercepts ntuple and cluster ntuple
number of track=2
momentum of each track > 3 GeV
accolinearity <10 deg
dr<2 dz<4



Efficiency are noted down inside the ods file for cuts #of svd>0 &&  # of pxd>0 using efficiency_calculation_3.C and all
for 412U, 512U,612U, 613U efficiencies are recalculated by applying cuts that intercepts are excluded in the region 108-276 U_stripID
